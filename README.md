# Multi_Simple_Storage_Solidity
This is a simple storage contract with an array that allows you to store and manage an array of data on the Ethereum blockchain,  with functions to interact with and manipulate that array. Users can add, retrieve, and modify elements in the array through the functions.

#SimpleStorageV0.8.0
This is a modified version of simplestorage with pragma solidity 0.8.0

#Storage Factory 
to create multiple instances of a contract with similar functionality. It's a way to deploy and manage multiple contract instances from a single contract, often referred to as the "factory" contract.

Here's a high-level explanation of how a storage factory works:

    Factory Contract: You create a factory contract that contains the logic for creating new instances of a target contract.

    Target Contract: This is the contract you want to deploy multiple instances of. It typically includes the logic and state variables that define the functionality you want to replicate.

    Factory Functions: The factory contract includes functions that allow users to create new instances of the target contract. These functions usually take any necessary initialization parameters and deploy new instances of the target contract.

    Instance Management: The factory contract may keep track of the deployed instances, often using an array or mapping to store references to them.

    Interaction: Users can interact with both the factory contract and the instances of the target contract. They can create new instances, query information about existing instances, and perform actions defined in the target contract.
